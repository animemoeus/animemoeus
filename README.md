# Arter Tendean

I work in system architecture, networking, and security.  
While you were busy chasing minors and singing a cappella, I was exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining root access to government servers. One click away from rewriting history.

I stop cross-site scripting dead.  
I catch DDoS attacks before they flood.  
I roll back failed databases when others are still panicking.  
I fix bad transactions before the CFO knows it happened.

The Internet, half a petabyte every minute — I’m the reason your filthy videos and music streams hit your shitty smartphone without crashing the whole system.

I make sure one bad config doesn’t wipe a billion-dollar company off the map.  
That’s what the fuck I do.
